/**
 * The add method for a dynamic array, as described in Code Fragment 7.5, has
 * the following inefficiency. In the case when a resize occurs, the resize
 * operation takes time to copy all the elements from the old array to a new
 * array, and then the subsequent loop in the body of add shifts some of them to
 * make room for a new element. Give an improved implementation of the add
 * method, so that, in the case of a resize, the elements are copied into their
 * final place in the new array (that is, no shifting is done).
