/**
 * To better model a FIFO queue in which entries may be deleted before reaching
 * the front, design a LinkedPositionalQueue class that supports the complete
 * queue ADT, yet with enqueue returning a position instance and support for a
 * new method, remove(p), that removes the element associated with position p
 * from the queue. You may use the adapter design pattern (Section 6.1.3), using
 * a LinkedPositionalList as your storage.
